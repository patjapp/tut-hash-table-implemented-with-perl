# tut-hash-table-implemented-with-perl
Class for a hash table in Perl to get an implementation idea of the hash data structure of Perl.

**Tutorial is under construction.**

The tutorial is based on the article ["How Hashes Really Work" by Abhijit Menon-Sen (Oct 1, 2002, read May 23, 2018)](https://www.perl.com/pub/2002/10/01/hashes.html/).
The commits in the repository follow a test-driven structure and are slightly different from the structure in the article.
